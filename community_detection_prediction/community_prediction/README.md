# Community Prediction Script 

## Individual 
Scripts logistic_regression.py and random_forest.py are used for each time period prediction. 
The script are generalized, it only requires to input the class 1 and class 0 training features and labels. 
There is a random selection function in the script to balance class 1 and class 0. It needs to adjust based input data. 

## Overall 
Scripts logistic_regression_combine_allMonth.py & random_forest_combine_allMonth.py are for competed year prediction. 
So the training data are combined pior to input into the scripts. Therefore, the scipts are almost the same as individual scripts.
